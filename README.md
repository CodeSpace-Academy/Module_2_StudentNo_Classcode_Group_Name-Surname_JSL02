# Introduction:
Intro to JS is a bit complicated compare to the SDF course, just when i thot ima getting the hang of this , then JS showed me that ,I am no where near.
Not everything is that complicated , thou the is a lot of terms to grasp.Still early days hope to understand better as we continue with the course.
# Challenges :
I struggled to understand the instruction at first , i had to do an extra research on how to go about it, when i finally got the how to, i bumbed in to understanding how some functions work,
I must say , i feel overwhelmed by the language.
# overall:
In time it will all make sense
